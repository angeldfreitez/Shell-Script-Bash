So, assuming that you're running on AWS linux you need to do the following:

install pocketmine

Get it from https://www.pocketmine.net/ and follow the linux instructions

edit minecraftpe with your favourite editor so that it points to your minecraft install directory

copy minecraftpe to /etc/init.d (which is where service scripts live in AWS linux)
	cp minecraftpe /etc/init.d

set permissions on minecraftpe
	chmod +x minecraftpe 

try and start it...

	service minecraftpe start

if that works, then set start to automatic:

	chkconfig minecraftpe on
