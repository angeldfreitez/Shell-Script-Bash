so, I use this script to autocommit any changes to my pocketmine install

i do this once an hour, all day, every day

as we all know, griefing can be a huge problem with minecraft

if you need to rollback your server you can simply do

git reset --hard [commitHash from the bitbucket website]

there's also a script I use to reset everything after doing the git reset

it's in this directory and called postReset.sh
