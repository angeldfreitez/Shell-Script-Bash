hello again

so this is the script I use to check for server crash and do a restart of the server

it works by checking for crashdumps... if it finds one it assumes the server had fallen over

you'll need to modify it slightly to point at your install directory

as ever, there's a thread on the pocketmine forum about these scripts

https://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/running-a-server-on-linux-some-tips.7234/#post-79397

good luck...

Dave
